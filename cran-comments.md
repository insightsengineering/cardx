## revdepcheck results

We checked 6 reverse dependencies, comparing R CMD check results across CRAN and dev versions of this package.

 * We saw 1 new problems
 * We failed to check 0 packages

The gtsummary failed reverse dependency checks.
I maintain this package and the failure is expected.
I will resubmit it as soon as this package is on its way to CRAN.

## Additional Comments

* Thank you for your time!
