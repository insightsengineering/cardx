The **{cardx}** package is an extension of the {cards} package, providing additional functions to create Analysis Results Data Objects (ARDs) using the **R** programming language.
The {cardx} package exports ARD functions that uses utility functions from {cards} and statistical functions from additional packages (such as, {stats}, {mmrm}, {emmeans}, {car}, {survey}, etc.) to construct summary objects.

Summary objects can be used to:

-   **Generate Tables and visualizations for Regulatory Submission**
    easily in **R**. Perfect for presenting descriptive statistics,
    statistical analyses, regressions, etc. and more.

-   **Conduct Quality Control checks on existing Tables** in R.
    Storing both the results and test parameters supports the re-use and
    verification of data analyses.

## Installation

Install cards from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("cardx")
```

You can install the development version of cards from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("insightsengineering/cardx")
```

## Examples

### Example ARD Creation

Example t-test:

```{r}
library(cardx)

cards::ADSL |>
  # keep two treatment arms for the t-test calculation
  dplyr::filter(ARM %in% c("Placebo", "Xanomeline High Dose")) |>
  cardx::ard_stats_t_test(by = ARM, variable = AGE)
```

Note that the returned ARD contains the analysis results in addition to
the function parameters used to calculate the results allowing for
reproducible future analyses and further customization.

### Model Input

Some {cardx} functions accept regression model objects as input:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lm(AGE ~ ARM, data = cards::ADSL) |>
  ard_aod_wald_test()
```

Note that the [Analysis Results Standard](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/analysis-results-standard) should begin with a data set rather than a model object.
To accomplish this we include model construction helpers.

```{r}
construct_model(
  x = cards::ADSL,
  formula = reformulate2("ARM", response = "AGE"),
  method = "lm"
) |>
  ard_aod_wald_test()
```

## Additional Resources

-   The best resources are the help documents accompanying each {cardx} function.
-   Supporting documentation for both companion packages [{cards}](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/) and {[gtsummary](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/index.html)} will be useful for understanding the ARD workflow and capabilities.
